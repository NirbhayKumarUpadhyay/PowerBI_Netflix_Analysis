## Project Overview
This Power BI project showcases the implementation of several advanced features including new reference labels, new slicers, Azure Geomapping, and embedding images in tables. These features enhance the interactivity, user experience, and data visualization capabilities of the report.

## Features Implemented

### 1. New Reference Labels

- **Purpose**: The new reference labels allow for enhanced annotation on visuals, making it easier for users to understand key metrics and trends.
- **Usage**: In this project, reference labels have been applied to important charts, such as sales trend lines and performance indicators, to highlight key data points like peak sales or target achievements.
- **Benefits**: This feature ensures users can quickly identify significant data points without manually scanning the entire visual.

### 2. New Slicers
- **Purpose**: Slicers improve interactivity by allowing users to filter data dynamically across the report.
- **Usage**: This project utilizes new slicer formats, including multi-select dropdowns and hierarchical slicers, to filter data by categories such as region, product, and time period.
- **Benefits**: The new slicers provide a more intuitive filtering experience, giving users the flexibility to analyze data with greater precision.
### 3. Azure Geomapping
- **Purpose**: Azure Geomapping integrates geographic data with Power BI, enabling advanced geospatial analysis and mapping capabilities.
- **Usage**: The report leverages Azure Maps to visualize data across different regions. This feature is used for sales by region and demographic analysis, providing deeper insights into geographical performance.
- **Benefits**: With Azure Geomapping, users can explore location-based insights, making it easier to spot geographic trends and patterns that are critical for decision-making.
### 4. Embedding Images in Tables
- **Purpose**: Embedding images in tables allows for a more visual representation of data, enhancing the user's ability to identify specific products or categories at a glance.
- **Usage**: In this project, product images have been embedded in the product performance table, allowing users to view the item alongside relevant data such as sales, ratings, and votes.
- **Benefits**: Visual elements like embedded images make reports more engaging and informative, improving user understanding and report aesthetics.

## Prerequisites
- **Power BI Desktop**: Ensure you have the latest version of Power BI Desktop installed to use all the features.
- **Azure Account**: Required for Azure Geomapping integration.
- **Data Source**: The dataset used in this project comes from a combination of internal sales records and external geographic datasets via Azure.
## How to Use the Report
- **Open the Power BI File**: Load the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
- **Explore the Slicers**: Use the slicers on the left-hand side to filter the report dynamically by different dimensions such as region, product type, and time period.
- **Reference Labels**: Hover over key visuals to view the reference labels for additional insights.
- **Maps**: Click on the Geographical Analysis tab to explore the Azure-powered maps for regional insights.
- **Embedded Images**: View the Product Performance table to see product images alongside performance metrics.
